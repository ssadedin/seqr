    <Header content="Restrictions on the Use of Shared and Group Accounts" size="medium" />
    You may not access seqr using group or shared accounts. The credentials used for authenticating to seqr must
    belong to a single individual.

    <Header content="Access Levels" size="medium" />
    Your level of access to systems and networks owned by Broad is limited to ensure your access is no more than
    necessary to perform your legitimate tasks or assigned duties. If you believe you are being granted access that
    you should not have, you must immediately notify seqr@broadinstitute.org.

    <Header content="Granting Access" size="medium" />
    Some seqr users may have the ability to grant access to projects and the data contained therein. These users are
    responsible for ensuring that permission is granted only to those who have adequate permissions to work with those
    data. If data are shared inappropriately or with unauthorized users through seqr, your access to seqr may be
    suspended or terminated and, in some instances, seqr staff may contact the user&apos;s institution.

    <Header content="Termination of Use" size="medium" />
    We may in our sole discretion suspend/terminate your access to seqr without notification. We may also periodically
    review and remove accounts for which a user has not logged on.

    <Header content="External Links" size="medium" />
    seqr provides links that are maintained or controlled by external organizations. The listing of links are not an
    endorsement of information, products, or services, and do not imply a direct association between the Broad and the
    operators of the outside resource links.

    <Header content="Content" size="medium" />
    By accessing seqr, you expressly consent to monitoring of your actions and all content stored within the Platform.
    We reserve the right to delete, move, or edit any data, which we consider to be unacceptable or inappropriate.

    <Header content="Disclaimer of Warranty" size="medium" />
    You expressly understand and agree that your use of seqr, or any material available through it, is at your own risk.
    Neither the Broad nor its employees warrant that seqr will be uninterrupted, problem-free, free of omissions, or
    error-free; nor do they make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from seqr.

    <Header content="Limitation of Liability" size="medium" />
    In no event will Broad, its affiliates or participating institutions, or their respective directors, officers,
    employees, faculty members or students be liable for any damages, include incidental, indirect, special, punitive,
    exemplary, or consequential damages, arising out of your use of or inability to use seqr, including without

    storage of any PHI on the platform. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless seqr of and from any and all claims,
    demands, losses, causes of action, damage, lawsuits, judgments, including attorneys&apos; fees and costs, arising
    out of or relating to your uploading, storing, or transferring of PHI.
